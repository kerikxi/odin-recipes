    <h2>Our Go-To Lasagna Recipe...</h2>
    <p>This recipe has been called the best by many and has thousands of 5-star reviews!</p>
    <p>It uses simple ingredients that you likely have on hand, and it packs big flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
        <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
        <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>
        <li>Spinach (variation): Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
