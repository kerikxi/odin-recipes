    <h2>Our Famous PotPie Recipe</h2>
    <p>Incredibly easy Homemade Chicken Pot Pie recipe with a creamy chicken and veggie-loaded filling and buttery, flaky crust (use my simple recipe or use store-bought!). This family-favorite meal is comforting, delicious, and simpler than you think!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter — I use unsalted butter then add salt later to taste but you can use any butter.</li>
        <li>Yellow or white onion, chopped — You can’t have homemade chicken pot pie without the onion and other veggies. Plus, when you melt that onion down with the butter it’s soooo very delicious.</li>
        <li>Carrots and celery — Two other key ingredients needed for easy chicken pot pies. I use whole, peeled carrots rather than baby carrots as I find them to be more flavorful. </li>
        <li>Salt and cracked black pepper — Add this to taste as you go along. </li>
        <li>Fresh thyme leaves — Fresh thyme works best but if you don’t have any then you can use ½ the amount of dried thyme. </li>
        <li>Chicken breasts, cubed — I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts because it’s much easier to cut them up. You could also use chicken thighs or even leftover turkey (see how, below).</li>
        <li>All purpose flour — All-purpose flour is key to getting the chicken pot pie to thicken inside the crust. </li>
        <li>White cooking wine (optional) — I use a cooking wine to add a bit of acidity to this recipe but you can skip it if you like.</li>
        <li>Low sodium chicken broth — I use a well-known brand of low-sodium chicken broth because I like to start my dishes with less salt and add as I go. Easier to add than to take salt away! </li>
        <li>Half and half or whole milk — Either will work here as the base for the chicken pot pie.</li>
        <li>Frozen peas — Any brand of frozen peas works in this dish. Peas are another must-have in a chicken pot pie, in my view anyway!</li>
        <li>Refrigerated pie crust — Make this dish easy on yourself and use a store-bought, refrigerated pie crust. </li>
        <li>Egg, lightly beaten — Beat an egg at the end to brush over the top of the crust to make it deliciously golden brown as it bakes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Melt the butter in a large skillet, Dutch oven, or frying pan set over a medium high heat. Stir in the onion, carrot and celery, along with a pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are soft and have started to color. </li>
        <li>Stir in the fresh thyme, followed by the chicken, seasoned well with salt and pepper. Cook until the chicken has started to brown.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with the flour and cook for a further minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the broth, and the heavy cream or milk. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened to slightly thinner than you want your finished pie filling. Stir in the frozen peas, and remove from the heat. Add a little more salt and pepper, if needed, and set aside to cool a little.</li>
        <li>While the filling is cooling, lightly butter a 9 inch pie plate and line with one of the pie crusts.</li>
        <li>Add the filling to the pie dish, and brush the exposed edges of the pastry with beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Lay the other pie crust on top, and press down to seal the edges. Trim off any excess with a sharp knife and crimp the edges.</li>
        <li>Brush the top of the pie with egg wash and cut a small slit in the middle to let out steam.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked and the top is golden – you may need a little more or a little less baking time if your oven runs a little hot or a little cold. Let the pie to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
